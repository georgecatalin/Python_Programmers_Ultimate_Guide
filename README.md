As a mid-level Python developer, I took **"Python Programmer's Ultimate Guide"** to brush up on the basics. It covers fundamentals thoroughly, with clear explanations of syntax, data types, and OOP, often illustrated with real-world examples, reinforcing core concepts I hadn't practiced recently.

The structured lessons and exercises effectively refreshed my knowledge, and I even picked up a few new insights and best practices. Though most content was familiar territory as expected, I appreciated the concise recap of key topics. Overall, it's a helpful refresher for someone with moderate Python experience, even if it occasionally feels a bit basic.
